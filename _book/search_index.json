This guidance has been created to support the Government Statistical Service, but has wider application across the analytical professions in government. 1.1 Who is this guidance for? This guidance is for producers of official statistics who are using or want to use new methods and techniques to improve and ensure that they use best practice in the production of statistics. The guidance is an introduction to techniques and methods, not a comprehensive learning resource. However, it is also not an introduction to coding. You are likely to get the most from this guidance if you are familiar with coding principles, have used a script based language before, or currently use R or Python for the production of statistics. At the end of chapters there are links to resources which provide a more comprehensive and in-depth guide to the methods. These are not the only learning resources available, but we have tried to link to ones that are used widely. 1.2 What is its aim? There is an increasing move in the production of statistics from legacy systems that are largely manual to workflows built using open source languages. This provides opportunities for using new tools and methods to enhance the quality of the systems used to produce statistics. Many producers of such systems are not data scientists or coding experts, but other analysts or non-analytical staff who may not be familiar with best practice in software development. This guidance aims to introduce some of the common approaches that are recommended for implementing a statistical output in a transparent and fully audited way. 1.3 What does it cover? A number of departments have implemented code to automate aspects of statistical production. This may involve having one or more scripts and functions which are run to achieve a part of production such as data validation or producing tables. 1.4 Terminology GIT SHELL VC Repository CLI GUI Unit Test "]
