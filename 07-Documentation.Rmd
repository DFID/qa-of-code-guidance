# Documentation

![](static/commenting.jpg)


An important part of producing statistics is documenting the process. This can be done in many ways but a common issue is that documentation isn't through enough and it be can be hand to understand how a process was done in the past and may rely on instutional memory which is dangerous. New tool open up different avenues for collecting documentation in ways which might be easier and better. However fundermentally time and effort needs to be put into documentating throughout the process otherwise in the future someone will have to crawl through your code to try and understand what you did.

## Commenting 


```
set_numbers = 1:10

even = function(x){
     data =  x %% 2 == 0 
     sum(data)
}

```


- Documenting code, inline documenting
- Readme for projects
- documenting function, in and out of packages
- Markdown for desk notes

The cost of commenting
Having agreed on the three basic arguments, let’s consider what is the cost of using comments:
Comments need maintenance, when refactoring code you have to refactor comments as well
Good comments are hard to write, good comments should be precise and relevant. Precision requires stability and well-defined requirements / environment that doesn’t change. Lack of changes is a luxury in modern software projects.
Temptation / culture that promotes using comments prevents developers from writing cleaner, explanatory code.
Comments hide design issues — the design of a system cannot be expressed effectively with the entities and abstractions that are clear and understandable
