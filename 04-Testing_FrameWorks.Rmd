# Testing Frameworks

## What excatly is a test

Testing is just checking that the expected result is the same as the actual result. Automated testing is moving from doing this in a informal ad-hoc way to an automated process which is repeatable.

Tests should be

* Fast
* Independent
* Repeatable (deterministic)
* Self-validating (no manual steps)
* Thorough (How much do you trust they cover everything?)

### Unit Test

### Intergration Tests

### Test Driven Development
