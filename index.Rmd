# QA for Coding 
  
This guidance is published as part of the Quality guidance published by BPI in the ONS. This guidance has been created to support the Government Statistical Service. 

## Reason for the Guidance

There is an increasing move in the production of statistics from legacy systems to open source langauges 


##  Pages
* Aiming for roughly 10 pages
* Each page should aim for around 300 - 400 words per page
* Was thinking that it would be possible to produce this guidance in markdown? That way we could include code chunks, maybe hide them

0. Introduction
- Who is this for
- it is for the QA of statistics code, in open source languages mainly
1. RAP
- Overview
- Minimal RAP??
  2. Level of RAP
- Examples?
  - One example, lower profile statistic, just long code scripts, basic git, no testing
- Second example, higher profile, more advanced along RAP stages, uses more advanced git/branching, testing, functions etc
- Rap QA process
3. Testing
- Why you should test your code
- What you should you test
- How do you know that your code is good without testing
4. Testing Strategies
- Unit Testing
- Check list for standard things to test
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Examples!
  5. Version Control with Git
- Why use Git
- Advantages of using Git
- version control
- Branching
- Roll back
- issues
- pull requests
- Peer review, share code
- other benefits!
  6. Peer Review
- internal / external
- other team members
- access to data
7. Documentation
- Documenting code, inline documenting
- Readme for projects
- documenting function, in and out of packages
- Markdown for desk notes
- coding standards
- documentation standards
8. Environment- Making sure that reproducible code can actually be reproduced!!
  - DATA- synthetic data, how peer review? produce dummy data?
  - Docker
- Packrat
- Documentation
9. Other Issues
-	Staff leave? Need to train up new people, documentation makes it easier.
-	Project need to be manageable for running in the long run
- Code Standards
- Link to resources
- Role and responsibility
- Terminology
- Managers
