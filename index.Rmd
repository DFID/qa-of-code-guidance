# Introduction
  
This guidance is published as part of the Quality guidance published by BPI in the ONS. This guidance has been created to support the Government Statistical Service. 

## Who is this guidance for?

This guidance is for producers of official statistics who are using or want to use new method and techniques to improve and ensure that they use the best practice in the productrion of statistics.

This is meant as an introduction to techiques and methods, not a compreheive learning resource. However, it is also not an introduction to coding, and you are likely to get more from this guidance if you are familar with coding principles, have used some script based language at some point, or currently use R/python for the production of statistics and are looking for how to increase the quality of your system. At the end of chapters there are links to resources which provide a more comprehive and indepth guide to the methods. These are not neccesarily the best or only learning resources.  

## What is its aim?

There is an increasing move in the production of statistics from legacy systems to open source languages. This provides oppunities for using new tools and methods to enhance the quality of the systems used to produce statistics. Many producers of these systems are not data scientists but other analysts or non-analytical staff and may not be familar with best practice in software development. This guidance aims to introduce you to some of the major methods recommended to be implemented in a statistical output. 

## What does it cover?

A number of departments have implemented code in their statistics to automate aspects of production. This may involve having a script whoch is run to achieve a part of production such as data valdiation or producing tables.
